      <h2>From Ether to Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Throughout the history of physics, the concept of empty space has functioned more as an operational
        approximation than as a physically defined entity. From classical mechanics to relativistic cosmology,
        the vacuum has been treated primarily as geometry, metric structure, or quantum fluctuation background,
        but never as a fully characterized physical substrate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The historical ether attempted to fill this conceptual void, proposing a propagation medium for
        electromagnetic phenomena. However, it failed not due to experimental refutation alone, but because it
        lacked a consistent physical formalism, predictive dynamics and covariant mathematical structure.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Structural Plenitude Theory emerges not as a revival of ether-like concepts,
        but as a structural reformulation of vacuum physics.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In SPT, the vacuum is understood as a continuous physical substrate — the Pleroma — exhibiting
        viscoelastic behavior, structural tension fields and dissipative regimes. Instead of treating spacetime
        as purely geometric, SPT introduces a physically reactive substrate where energy, matter and radiation
        emerge as responses to coupling conditions within this continuum.
      </p>

      <h3>The Pleroma as Physical Substrate</h3>

      <p>
        Within this framework, the Pleroma is not a reference frame, nor a propagation medium in the classical
        sense. It is a structural continuum whose internal tension gradients, impedance transitions and coupling
        efficiency determine how physical phenomena manifest across scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        Light propagation, gravitational behavior and cosmological redshift are interpreted as emergent
        responses of this substrate, rather than purely geometric effects or metric distortions.
      </p>

      <h3>From Geometry to Structure</h3>

      <p>
        Standard cosmology successfully models large-scale structure using metric expansion and relativistic
        field equations. However, several observational anomalies suggest the presence of structural behaviors
        not fully captured by purely geometric frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        SPT proposes that part of these anomalies can be reinterpreted as signatures of substrate interaction
        effects, including structural drag in high-velocity interstellar objects, asymmetric plasma and radiation
        behavior, non-thermal dissipation regimes and residual coupling effects across astrophysical boundaries.
      </p>

      <h3>Observational Motivation</h3>

      <p>
        The motivation for SPT does not arise from a single anomaly, but from the accumulation of independent
        observational patterns across multiple domains of astrophysics and space plasma physics.
      </p>

      <h3>Evolution of the Theory</h3>

      <p>
        SPT evolved through successive conceptual and mathematical consolidation stages, culminating in
        version 1.4, where the theory establishes a unified substrate framework integrating viscoelastic vacuum
        dynamics, covariant coupling formalism, structural impedance modeling and dissipative cosmological regimes.
      </p>

      <h3>Scientific Positioning</h3>

      <p>
        Structural Plenitude Theory does not claim to replace existing cosmological frameworks. Instead, it
        proposes an additional structural layer capable of explaining phenomena that may lie outside purely
        geometric or particle-based interpretations.
